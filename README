FlashLogger
===========

  This plugin logs flash messages with whatever keys you specify in your environment.rb file

  it does this by overriding the ActionController flash method and returning a Flash like object that delegates back 
  to the original flash object.  Before it does the delegation it calls a newly included log method that creates a record 
  in the flash_messages table

Example
=======

  [ config ]
    flash_logger.flash_types :error, :failure

  [ usage ]
    
    call log_flash_messages in whatever controller you'd like to log the messages for.  Alternatively you can place it in 
    application_controller if you want all messages logged

    Class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

      log_flash_messages

    end
